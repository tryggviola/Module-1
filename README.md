#  HTML & CSS - Introduction // Project 1

## Project brief 

Create a simple one page website using HTML and CSS. 

## The Goal 
<ul>
<li>Learn fundimentals of HTML and CSS </li>
<li>Setup Git and Github </li>
<li>Release the website on the web.</ul>
</ul>


## Intro
I wanted to create a basic digital portfolio which showcases my future school projects and I will be adding features and other stuff to it when my skills develop. I had alot of fun creating this site and the whole process was very intresting to me. 


## The Process

I started off designing the site in <strong>Figma</strong> and the design is suprisingly close to the final site except for some hover effect and minor details which I will hopefully add to it later. After the design was ready I put all my text and images into a HTML code in <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> and then added the CSS layer on it and then uploaded it to Github.


## The journey

In "The Process" chapter it sounds all really simple when actually it was incredibly hard since I have no prior experience but I learned so much doing it. The easiest part for me was designing it because Figma was really easy to use and there is alot of great tutorials and help online. The hardest part was the actual coding and I had to start over a couple of times but I finally got the hang of it and I have a much better understanding because of it.


## What I am happy about

I am really happy with the site overall, the design is all right and the code is pretty good. I like that I started over and made the flex-box and I am really happy how it scales (the project images and the about section)


## What I would like to do better 
Even though I am happy with the scaling there are some things I would like to do better there. I also did not add any hovering effects that I planned for in Figma but I will add them in later on for sure. 


## Conclusion 

I had a blast and I learned so much, not just how to do things but to google them, sorting through all the information and actually finding what you are looking for. Seeing an idea coming to live through all the stages is incredibly fulfilling and I cant wait to tackle the next project.
